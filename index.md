# Of the moon

The transmission window would open in a few hours, but Crea had more to add to the messages she would send out. She had finished updating her formal notes. Now she was excited to recount recent developments for her mother. She had prepared a video message weeks ago, and she was approaching the maximum amount of data she could send before the window closed, so she contented herself with attaching an audio recording. She had to remember to leave space for a hasty response to whatever her mother would say to her, too, when the message came through. But it would be tough! There was so much to tell.

It had really all come out of nowhere in the past few days. First, she had discovered a new door! Cunningly disguised as yet more rock, what tipped her off were the engravings she was just beginning to learn to interpret. She noticed patterns that matched the first door they had found. Her scanner hadn't picked them up because they weren't duplicates, but a second half. A continuation of each symbol, that aligned perfectly. She needed to recalibrate her equipment to look for more of that. She had a feeling the patterns weren't complete yet. That is... she had a feeling there were more doors.

It had only taken her three days (by the Earth's rotation) to open this one. She was finally beginning to understand this place. Understand wasn't the right word though. It wasn't very scientific, but she was beginning to *intuit* this place. The first one had taken three and a half months, and she had achieved that after others had been working on it for... Well, she didn't know. Nobody had mentioned. But she had the impression it had been a very long time. She had been hailed as a genius when she succeeded. She had almost given up, convinced after one hundred days that she was getting nowhere. Confused as to why her funding hadn't been pulled after so much time with no results. But she did it, and now she was running the place. It was all hers.

Crea had a whole moon to herself.

And what a moon! Behind the new door, was a new room. That was even more exciting than the door. It contained tomes. Giant manuscripts, stacks upon stacks. They were made of the same kind of thick, leaf textured papyrus as the ones in the first chamber, but subtly heavier, and more yellowed in tone. The inscriptions were smaller, too. Crea hadn't figured out what the ink was made from yet, but she suspected that the greater concentration of the writing contributed towards the weight.

This was not the most incredible thing however. The most incredible thing was behind the tomes. A three dimensional scan of the space had revealed it at once. Behind rows of towers of books, were tablets. *Engraved* tablets. The scan was high quality; Crea didn't need to access them to visualise their surface. Slabs of rock - not the same rock that the cave walls were made from - it was utterly unfamiliar in makeup. But the materials in this place were a secondary priority, anyway. The pieces were slotted into the wall itself, held in individually carved spaces. And the wall was *full*. Some of the pieces were stacked against the side, like headstones in an overcrowded graveyard, and later (she assumed) covered with the books.

There was so much here. Twice as much as they suspected, at least. She barely knew where to start. Except... and breathe... She did know where to start. At the entrance. She should not get carried away with the second chamber. And she had all the time she needed. She would study all of it, she felt sure.

After this afternoon's transmission, nobody would disturb her again for another six months. Crea checked her timer, checked her remaining disc space, and saved the recording. Her mother was the only person who enjoyed listening to her ramble on about her work, or at least who could do a good impression of doing so. She attached the audio to the package of data poised to be transmitted out when the airwaves were clear, and started randomly browsing her notes in case she'd missed something critical the scientists on the planet's surface would need to see. She had a lot of notes.

Crea checked her timer again. Ten Earth minutes had passed. Four Sagga minutes. Lutati didn't have minutes. Nothing changed enough on the moon to make it worth measuring. The transmission window was to open on Earth's schedule, even though no-one from Earth would be sending or receiving anything. Most official things still ran on Earth's schedule, in fact. When Crea was a student, she had taken part in a  campaign for the university to use Sagga's timing primarily. Once, she and her friends had broken into a laboratory and re-calibrated all of the equipment. They didn't know what the equipment was used for, or even what went on in that laboratory. Alarms had sounded, and the campus had been shut down for almost a week. The five of them had escaped through a window, broken into a nearby dormitory, and laid low in the closet of a sympathetic first year for two days. The kid was terrified of getting caught, and went out to buy them food rather than let them order pizza for delivery. He switched dorms a week later.

The university never did adjust its timekeeping, maintaining good relations with collaborators on Earth was too important. They had plenty to say a year later when Earth's Council for Extraterrestrial Affairs excluded academics from Sagga from applying for joint grant funding with Earth-based institutions however. Sagga needed to strike out on its own, the Council said, assert itself as an independent nation. Besides, collaboration through the wormhole was time-consuming and resource-intensive. Crea and most of her friends at the time agreed with the university's new position that Earth was abandoning them, and they were better off without. Earth took too much, and gave too little in return.

Crea had been at a protest, too, a year after *that*, when a delegation from Sagga had gone to Earth to negotiate complete devolution of power to the Board of Overseers. Devolution was not enough; they wanted independence. They didn't know it at the time, but that was to be the last ever use of the Lunar Passageway. It took a while for people to realise that the delegation was not coming back. The last message from Earth - that operation of the Lunar Passageway was ceasing until further notice - shook the small nation into action. After barely a year of floundering, the new Government of Sagga was pouring everything it had into scientific research and technological development. Everyone had a job to do. Those who lacked expertise were trained. Sagga's environment was coaxed into flourishing despite the altitude of the land, and its sole city began to expand into a state. 

In between mandatory tech placements, Crea studied her heritage. The second generation of native Saggans was being born, and they might never know of Earth. She grilled her mother for everything she knew of the blue planet, even though she had been young when she arrived on Sagga. She pursued her mother's friends, their parents if they were still around, then chased the gradually settling refugees; those who had been visiting Sagga when the wormhole was closed, who had been left stranded. Crea's thesis was a vast compendium of interviews; an interactive archive of experiences of the early settlers and their descendants. One could view it, and even add to it, at the Sagga Museum, alongside Earthly artifacts like tree branches and shells.

Science and industry continued to use time keeping instruments based on the rotations of a planet in another galaxy; of a star half way across the universe.

No matter how you measured it, time was standing still for Crea. Still one hour to go before she could transmit. Crea stepped away from her console and walked around the corner, to the entrance of her cave. On her way out, she shed her loose jacket, depositing it in a heap on the floor. She curled her toes over the edge of the rock that formed her entry way, and let the vertigo seize her for a moment. The cave was in the side of a sheer cliff and the entry way jutted out over an impossible drop. There were steps beside the entrance, leading up and over. They were mostly a natural formation, but Crea had helped them take shape a little by grinding away sharp edges. She took them delicately, on tiptoes, her arms spread wide for balance. Her heart was racing by the end of the steep ten minute climb to the very peak of the cliff, and her feet were covered in the soft orange pink dust that coated this moon.

At the top, she sat cross-legged. The sun of the perpetual dusk warmed her bare arms. The larger star, Ava, dipped below the horizon directly ahead, and Crea could feel the warmth from its sibling Mira on the back of her head. The sky was shot with oranges, pinks and reds. The planet Sagga was a white smudge. Her mother would be  preparing a meal usually at this time, but today she would instead be fussing around unfamiliar technology, afraid to miss the call from her daughter, and excited to transmit her own message. The house would be uncomfortably full of scientists and beeping devices, and probably one or two people from the authorities. There would be black, serious looking vehicles outside, and equally serious looking guards to protect the beeping devices. Her mother, amidst the flurry, would be somehow keeping them all liberally supplied with tea.

Crea spent a moment more looking across the landscape. Her moon, Lutati, was broken and uneven. More a cluster of rocks held together by the miracle of gravity than a complete entity. She could walk its perimeter, and arrive back where she started, in a few days if it was flat. When she trained for this assignment, she had been made to walk enormous distances on Sagga. It was for naught, as the moon was torn to pieces; there was no route she could take that wasn't split by an impassable crevasse.

Crea closed her eyes. Nothing moved but the tiny hairs above her lip as her breath floated by. Her breath was a gentle hum; almost silent, but the only sound in the world. Her ankle buzzed, disgruntled at the pressure she was putting on it. The backs of her hands tingled at their contact with the linen of her trousers, and the tops of her knees were warmed by the backs of her hands. Her buttocks communed with every grain of dust beneath her. Her lower back was heating up, and discomfort seeped around her kidneys. Crea straightened her spine. The movement caused tips of her hair to tickle the back of her neck. The ground beneath her passed on messages from the cave below; the hum of her equipment, coupled with vibrations of the secrets held within. The top of her head was cool, out of direct line of either Ava or Mira. The moon's gravity pulled gently at the hundreds of hairs protruding from her scalp. An itch arose on her left forearm. The sensation teased her for a moment, and then was gone.

On Sagga there was always wind. It tousled her hair, lifted it and threw around, and the lower gravity meant Crea always looked wild. Most people covered their heads, to go outside if not all the time, but Crea imagined she was being tugged into space. Great hands reached for her from above, and they needed something to latch on to. Now she was here, nothing was tugging her back to Sagga. The moon had her, and she had the moon. Nothing tousled her here; all was still, all was stable.

The air was warm when it entered her lungs, but warmer when it left. The insides of her nostrils affirmed it. Crea was sharing energy with the moon, a fair exchange. The atmosphere seeped into every pore of her skin. It took longer to get to her legs, back and chest, first having to pass through her clothes. It made it though, and caressed every part of her body. The moon embraced Crea, and her heart opened wider in return.

Crea softly opened her eyes. She blinked Lutati's landscape back into focus. Sagga's primary moon, Bella, and the Lunar Passageway station itself had made an appearance on the horizon, so it would soon be time. Crea had been to Bella twice, but stepped foot on its surface only once. It didn't really count though, because she hadn't breathed its air, touched its atmosphere. Bella didn't have an atmosphere to speak of. Crea had spent the entire journey from Sagga to Bella begging, sweet talking, and otherwise cajoling the shuttle captain to let her try on a space suit and step outside. She had the training to do so, after all. After much reluctance and much breaching of protocol, and under very close supervision, and only for one minute mind you, the captain conceded. Bella was grey, like Earth's moon. It's surface was gritty and crumbly where Lutati was soft and powdered.

Crea rose slowly, and took the steps down to the cave entrance one by one. On the way back in she retrieved her jacked and slipped her feet into loose sackcloth shoes, and padded back to her workstation. Her seat was suspended from the roof of the cave - an anti-sand measure which didn't work because she immediately tucker her feet underneath herself without dusting them off. It squeaked as she reached for her screen. With a few taps and swipes she lined the files up for transmission. Her message to her mother first, and then the data she had collected and the analysis she'd done so far. Whilst they were sending, she could download incoming transmissions. She would have time to watch or listen to a message from her mother and to record a response to add to the end of the queue. It would finish sending just before the window closed. 

The visitors to her mother's house would be doing the same thing on their end. If they were all lucky, an additional message from her mother might squeeze through in the last moments, too.

Crea was poised.

*boop*

The transmitter kicked into life. Each message was broken into chunks by her software (it was hers, at least, she helped write it), packaged and repackaged until it could be propelled through space. With each chunk sent, a square on the screen filled with colour. The display was split, to show progress on their end as well as hers. When each bundle of data reached its destination, a square was filled in on their side too. Sometimes one didn't make it intact, and Crea had to nudge it to send again. The chunks might arrive out of order, but they would put it all back together.

Nothing had arrived yet. Crea's transmitter was sending, but the data had a long way to go. The waves of energy squeezed out of Lutati's thick atmosphere, propelling a path between particles. Then they would hit the vacuum of space and surge forward. In the wrong direction. The station built around the Lunar Passageway provided an ad hoc deflector to redirect them. They bounced once, into Bella. This slowed their particles down considerably, and changed their direction once more. The next time they entered the vacuum, they were bound for Sagga. The antenna installed in the field behind Crea's mother's house waited patiently as the data fought its final battle against the planet's atmosphere. Eventually the first packet would make it, the dish would send an acknowledging ping on a different frequency, and one of the 'received' squares would finally light up.

Crea waited.

She kicked her legs out from under her, scattering sand across the desk. She dropped to the ground and turned her swing seat inside out, shaking the rest of the dust to the floor. She brushed off her desk. One more packet sent, still none received. On either end. Lutati's atmosphere must be extra thick today.

Crea rolled her jacket sleeves down to her wrists, bouncing on the balls of her feet. She rolled them back up again. She twisted her black hair into a bun on the top of her head, dragging it round and round until it was so tight it hurt. She let go and it tumbled back down to her shoulders. She placed her palms on the desk and leaned forward until her nose was almost touching the screen. The static made her skin bristle, and from here she could hear its hum. Crea stepped back, hands on her hips, a frown furrowing her brow. She perched back into her chair, but not all the way, so her feet still brushed the ground. With a big toe, she drew shapes in the sand.

*Ugh.*

An exasperated sigh. She dropped to the ground again and peer around the back of her desk. The screen was plugged into the power source and the transmitter. The transmitter was plugged into the power source too, and its light was blinking rapidly. As it should be. She followed the cable from its third outlet down to the ground and up a narrow shoot in the rock behind her desk. She stretched as high as she could with her arm through the chute, fingering the cable as far as she could reach. She leaned back around to look at her screen, and sighed again.

Her sleeves were unrolled once more, and she chewed on a corner of the fabric. Briskly she re-rolled them, and jogged to the cave entrance. She turned right and scrambled up and over some rocks, no steps on the other side. Where the chute from inside the cave emerged, there was a small dish. She needlessly brushed sand from it as she crouched down, checking the cable here too. The dish was warm to touch, but not hot; a combination of the suns' heat and its electrical activity. Crea looked to the sky. The Lunar Passageway station was in alignment, outlined by the colossal grey Bella. Had Bella's orbit changed? Had they calculated something wrong? What if someone tampered with the deflector on the station? What if the Passageway itself had been reactivated? The particles it emitted would certainly interfere with her signal.

She chewed her lip, and looked further to Sagga, willing her messages home.

The only time Crea had been on the Lunar Passageway station was to protest. It was a unique occasion, with a special transport for protesters organised by the Sagga Association for Greater Autonomy (SA-GA). The flight from Sagga took two days, and in this instance around two hundred students were crammed into a commercial cargo transport shuttle. Crea had spent most of the journey pressed into a hard metal corner, carefully rationing the protein bars her backpack was bursting with, and catching up on reading for her latest technology development assignment. Others busted around, playing games, singing songs, making ever more elaborate signboards, and practicing their protest chants. Her two closest companions spent half of the journey trying to get onto the flight deck to question the crew about space aviation. Crea had declined to accompany them; they returned periodically with stories of their various failures, and eventually gave up, took sedatives, and went to sleep.

She had never taken an ordinary passenger shuttle off Sagga until her first trip to Lutati. Having a reclining seat, access to a food dispenser, and a much smaller person-to-bathroom ratio made for a much more enjoyable voage, despite Lutati's greater distance.

It was on board the transport to the Lunar Passageway station when Crea's interest in long distance communications had been piqued. An aside in one of the academic articles she had skimmed noted the difficulty of reliably transporting bulk loads of data from Earth to the machine-controlled base station on Mars, and back. The intricacies of this problem nestled in the back of her mind, and resurfaced again several months later when she was placed on a team tasked with building transmission software capable of reaching the outer edges of Sagga's solar system.

The vessel carrying the protesters docked at a transfer point on the surface of Bella, and they were hustled in small groups into pods, essentially elevators, to whoosh up to the Lunar Passageway station itself. Crea was lucky to make the cut. At some point, authorities cited capacity problems, and blocked about one third of the protesters from reaching the station. The recreational facilities at Bella were lacklustre at best, and dozens of impatient students were left to antagonise the security forces for several hours.

The Lunar Passageway station was shiny. It was in much better repair than the aging transfer station on the moon's surface. As her group was guided to an area set aside for demonstrators, Crea dawdled to absorb a history in pictures along its corridor walls. The images were three dimensional holograms, and the captions were engraved directly into the glimmering metal. They depicted the construction of the station following the discovery of Bella. The discovery of the Passageway itself by researchers on Earth's Moon had several meters dedicated to it. The international conflict about access to the Passageway, and the sudden availability of support for Moon infrastructure by nations previously not interested in funding space exploration was merely a footnote. The timeline skipped the years after construction of the transit stations on the moons at both ends, during which political division had prevented any real progress from being made. There was no mention of the private companies which had sprung up without government support. Credit for the discovery and subsequent occupation of Sagga was given to a cohort of international Earth organisations, containing governments, academic institutions, and enthusiastic citizen scientists.

From this history, the settlement of Sagga looked as peachy as Lutati's sands. A triumph for all nations on Earth, and a step towards the future.

On multiple occasions while she was compiling her thesis, Crea tried to arrange a return trip to the Lunar Passageway station to document this display first hand. With the Passageway closed by Earth, none of the shuttle lines had thought to operate transit for station tourism, and there was nothing for people to visit on Bella. Later, the only people who could access the station were diplomats, desperately trying to renegotiate access to Earth for those on Sagga.

Transmitting messages through the Lunar Passageway itself was a whole different ballgame. Much of the research for that, spanning the years since the Passageway's discovery, was closed. However, Crea had accessed what she could when she worked in a communications lab. The Passageway collapsed hundreds of lightyears of space into just a few kilometers distance. When the Passageway was open, one could see Earth's Moon from Bella, and vice versa. The respective stations at the ends of the Passageway were designed to permit that. The Lunar Window. 

The station above Bella hosted an enormous transparent panel to welcome new arrivals. Once inside the station proper, only space was visible through this window; it was angled to benefit those transiting through the Passageway.

From were Crea stood on the station during the protest, she had been able to see the Passageway open up as the shuttle housing the representatives from Sagga entered. Black, empty space shimmered. The void became a pool, quivering due to the proximity of matter. Then the Moon appeared, at first like a reflection in a lake, until it trembled into solidity. The Moon's transit station was a shining spec in orbit. The shuttle jetted off in its direction, and the whole apparition phased back out of existence.

*Did you see Earth?* Crea had heard someone nearby whisper excitedly. *That wasn't Earth. We can't see Earth from here. But we'll get there one day.*

Some of the protesters, perhaps, weren't here to impress upon the delegates the importance of Sagga's self-governance, but to try to glimpse the greener grass of the blue planet they had never seen.

Most of the data segments were sent, and it wouldn't be long until the transmission window closed altogether. Crea leaned forward on the desk, her elbows boring dents into the clear polycarbonate. She massaged her temples, pulled on her cheeks and earlobes, pressed her palms into her eyes.

*boop.*

The final package was sent. Her face an inch from the screen, Crea tapped the controls to re-send the first blob again. She ran her hands through her hair, bundling and unbundling it on the top of her head. It sent. Still nothing on the receiving end. Nothing from her mother. No acknowledgements.

Maybe it was just her end that was broken. Maybe everything had been sent fine and her equipment just wasn't receiving. There were probably ten people pushing buttons and swiping dials in her mother's kitchen right now, and nobody would be telling her mother what was going on. In fact, her mother would be blissfully unaware that anything was wrong at all, in another room, hand against her heart and tears in her eyes as she watched her daughter's video for the fifth time over.

*boop.*

Lutati, Bella and Sagga would be in alignment again in around another six months.

Crea dropped back into her swing seat, leaning all the way back. Her hair claimed particles of dust from the ground and her fingertips left trails in the sand. She breathed out, long and slow. She hung there until the blood rushing in her ears became too loud to bear. She hauled herself back upright then, and waited for the dizziness to pass. 

A glance at her screen; a gnaw of concern in the pit of her stomach. Crea wandered to the back of the part of the cave in which she lived. She placed her hands against the stone and closed her eyes. Behind this wall was *everything*. She could see every inch of every surface in the room. Her mind wandered across dusty volumes, traced the intricate patterns on their covers. Stories of a civilisation, waiting to be told.

She sighed and tramped deeper into the cave. The corridor narrowed and got darker; the ground began to slope downwards. She relinquished her grip and let gravity glide her cloth-covered feet over fine loose stones for a few moments. The narrow passage continued, but Crea turned right and hoisted herself through a hole in the wall. Without a light, you'd only know it was there if you knew it was there. She emerged behind a rock in a wide but low-ceilinged cavern. With her chin to her chest she advanced until her foot kicked into a box on the ground. She bent to turn it over, and the cavern was illuminated momentarily by two green lights blinking.  She dusted them off and put the box back down; the tension of the cables protruding from both sides jerked it back into its lights-down position. One cluster of several thing cables disappeared into a hole in the ground a couple of meters away. They connected to a power relay under her desk, which in turn kept her screen on and her flashlight and stove charged. The other cable was as thick as her wrist, and made its way through another tunnel across the cavern. At some point it forked, and emerged at the two positions on Lutati's surface with the most intense and consistent sunlight from Ava and Mira. Sheets of silver paneling covered the ground, soaking up the energy.

If anything went wrong with these, there was not a lot Crea could do. She had no means to traverse Lutati's inconveniently jagged terrain to reach them. This equipment was old, well tested, and notoriously reliable though. Panels like these had kept Sagga powered for decades, in the early years. She had a backup supply of good old fashioned oil stashed away for emergencies in any case, which would last six months on a budget.

So, energy source was good. She had better go back and run diagnostics on all the rest of her equipment too. Not that she had much, but if she was going to need to panic at all she was better off finding out sooner rather than later.

Back in her cave, Crea collected all of her electrical equipment into a heap on the floor. She had a device that made light, one that made heat, and one that made high frequency vibrations. They could be purposed in all kinds of ways, in various combinations, but primarily they served Crea as a flashlight for the cave tunnels, a stove, and a showerhead. She picked them up and put them down again, one by one. Paused for a moment. Picked the heater back up, and took it to the cave entrance. She stood it upright, flicked a switch to open upward facing support arms, and balanced a bowl atop those. On her right, set a little back from the entrance, was an enormous chest. From within she produced a bean the size of a pebble, which she dropped into the pot with a light clatter. She turned up the heat, and sat down beside the stove. In the distance, Bella had drifted further overhead and Ava had sifted just a little across the horizon. Crea's attention jolted back to the pot as the bean puffed up, doubling in size. It burst, spitting brown globules against the sides of the bowl; the globules continued to expand and sizzle. Crea reached into the pot with a pair of tongs and retrieved from the bubbling liquied a bean which looked a lot like the one she had put in to begin with. She returned it to its place in the chest, and idly stirred her simmering stew.

When she was a student, one of Crea's dorm mates studied plant sciences. She had gone on to be a key figure in developing self-replicating foods on Sagga. In another lifetime, Crea would learn how this process worked.

Crea smelled the contents of the pot. It smelt... brown. As always, it would be rich and satisfying, and provide her with all the nutrients she needed. She lowered the heat, and returned to the chest. She surveyed her sack of flour and gallon of water, neither of which were self-replicating. Into another bowl she scooped flour, and drizzled water, stirring it together with her hand, just enough until a ball formed. Crea took once more a seat on the ground at the cave entrance, and gazed up at Bella as she massaged the dough between her palms.

Pull the ball into a disc. Fold the disc in half. Stretch, fold, stretch, fold. Roll it back into a ball. Roll and roll more to extend the ball into a cylinder. Turn the tip in and make a spiral. Press it flat, fold the disc in half. Repeat. A couple of rounds of this was plenty to make airy, layered flatbread, but Crea was on her seventh repetition when she smelt something somewhat charred. She scrambled to her feet and snatched the stew pot from the stove. It hissed as it landed in the sand. She placed the dough ball back in its bowl, and scraped around the edges of the brown goo with her tongs. It was pretty well stuck to the sides. She knew from experience its taste and nutritional value would not be affected though.

Crea dug a flat pan from the chest and let it heat, rolling the dough ball between her hands some more while she waited. She broke the dough into four smaller balls and spread one out on a plate, flattening it with her palm until it was almost see through. Carefully she picked it up with her fingertips and dropped it into the pan. It immediately began to swell and bubble. Crea flipped it over; the underside was just starting to brown. She flipped it out of the pan and onto the plate. Three more times, and she turned the stove off.

She gathered her pot of stew and plate of flatbread, and traversed the steps to the top of the cave once more. Bella and the Lunar Passageway station were at her back now. She used the bread as a spoon, scooping stew into her mouth. The bread was soft and flaky, and she relished the contrast.

A small dollop of brown narrowly missed her knee. It absorbed the dust, and solidified. With nothing to eat her waste, the waste ate Lutati. Crea's mother had told her once about Tepi, a non-human family member back on Earth. Against the will of her parents, Crea's mother would discard scraps of food underneath the table, and Tepi would efficiently vacuum them up. Tepi had four legs and and a tail, shaggy fur, and dopey eyes. Tepi would place her hands on Crea's mother's shoulders, and lick at her face. Crea's mother would often fall to the ground under Tepi's embrace; she recalled this with a fondness Crea didn't quite understand. They left Tepi behind, so as not to interfere with Sagga's ecosystem. As if humans were somehow neutral agents. It was best, Crea's mother supposed, because Sagga had slugs and fat red bugs, and Tepi liked to eat anything that squiggled through the mud.

Crea had tried keeping a slug as a pet when she was small, but she had never managed to forge quite the same level of affection with it as her mother had with Tepi. She had gone so far as to name it, but didn't recall what any more.

Lutati was her companion now. Lutati, and its rocks and sand and dust. Every particle was there for her when she needed it. Crea had been pressing her fingers into the sand and was almost up to her wrist. She dug her other hand in alongside. She squeezed balls of sand in her fists, the grains massaged her palms, relieving itches she never knew she had. Beneath the surface, the sand was cool. Not damp, just cool. Ava and Mira's rays were not powerful enough to penetrate deeply. 

On Sagga, Crea had been to the coast many times. There was only one piece of land on the planet, which the settlers occupied, and its coastline was varied, but nowhere had sand like Lutati. Her favourite seaside spot on Sagga had clay. Thick, black, and cold, it made a *smack smack* sound under her feet. If you stood still for long enough, and closed your eyes, and listened to the sea, it would gradually give way beneath you. The clay was never welcoming like Lutati's sands. It was reluctant to take you in, a begrudging host to visitors from above. Impatient, Crea would plunge her hands in to feel the mud slide between her fingers. If she squeezed hard enough, she could pull out almost-solid balls. When she threw them, they hit the surface with a *splat*, and were absorbed much more readily than her feet had been. When she was very young, she would escape from her mother and slather herself from head to toe in clay, then lay down, camouflaged, and wait to be found, or run around her mother and her friends bellowing like a beast. Crea's mother grumbled about the mess, but would herself smear clay on her cheeks and into her hair from time to time, and bottle a little to take home as well.

-----

Crea tossed and turned, making her hammock sway. She was too hot with the cover, but too cold without it. She never normally had trouble sleeping. This was the first time in over six months of being in the cave. The fact made her anxious. Or was it something else making her anxious? Her eyes were still squeezed closed, but for a fleeting moment she felt like she was being watched. The feeling passed at once, and she carefully slowed her breath, and didn't open her eyes. She could get up and work but... she was exhausted. She pictured herself sitting up, swinging her legs over the side and dropping the couple of inches to the floor. She imagined padding across the mat that kept most of the sand and grit off her feet, towards her desk in the far corner. The corner near the door. She would hoist herself up into the swing seat, then lean forwards and tap her screen. The screen would blink to life, showing her the most recent document scan she'd been working on. Which one was it? She couldn't quite recall. She had left off half way through the last one. She could swipe her finger around the screen to rotate the scan, pinch to zoom. She was searching for new symbols, something she hadn't come across yet to add to her dictionary. Some dictionary. What kind of dictionary only had icons but no definitions? No translation? But she would get there. She had time. First she needed to gather data, then she could analyse it. In her mind's eye, Crea saw herself zooming in on a section of the scan which the computer had marked with a red outline. There was something there that it hadn't been able to extract and automatically classify. She tried to make it out, but it was blurry. Maybe she should get up for real and take a look after all. She didn't remember noticing this highlighted section on the last piece she worked on though. Maybe she hadn't rotate it all the way around yet. The section was in the bottom at the center.. no in the corner. It was just the cover of the book, she hadn't even gone inside yet. The inscriptions on the pages appeared to be a completely different alphabet, so she had decided to take just the covers first. She had time. What was in the highlighted section? She really should get up and find out. She thought she was sitting up for a moment, but perhaps she had drifted off and dreamt it. She tried again, but her body was a boulder. Crea rolled onto her side. Her eyes were still closed, and it seemed impossible to wrench them open. She felt the course fabric of the hammock under her cheek where the sheet had wrinkled away. Her face and the material were joined, inextricably linked, as one. She couldn't get up. She nuzzled the hammock and stretched her limbs. A small groan escaped her. She either needed to get up and do some work or go to sleep, really. She couldn't just stay here, neither being productive nor restoring her energy. Why did she feel so heavy? Finally she lurched upright and swung her legs over the edge. For real this time. She pulled the cover aside and felt the taught rim of the hammock in the backs of her knees. She allowed herself to lean forwards, unconsciously stretching her toes for the floor. Crea slipped off the edge, and the floor never came.

She jerked awake, heart in her mouth. Still in the hammock. Her eyes were open now but she could see nothing in the darkness. Her breathing slowed. She pulled the cover around her shoulders and stared at the ceiling. Resisting the urge to look over at her desk. She remembered she had finished the last cover she had been analysing after all. There had been only one new symbol, and a handful of new combinations. Nothing the computer couldn't read, that was for sure. She had begun to feel hopeful that perhaps she was starting to get a complete picture, of the covers at least. But something niggled. What if she had missed something? She had got through dozens of the books so far, and with the computer to help her she was normally confident of her progress. In any case, she could check in the morning. Just to be on the safe side. The sense of urgency was gone altogether now; her dream faded.

Crea rolled over again, this time onto her right side, facing away from the desk. Finally she was ready to sleep. Thoughts of enormous books, stone tablets, and mysterious carvings flitted through her mind, but dissipated as quickly as they came. She sank gently into oblivion.

On the other side of the cave, her screen flickered to life and the computer started to reanalyse the file that had been open last. This time, it found something different.

---------

The training for this mission had been rigorously routine. Crea had gone along with it, keenly aware that once she was deep in to the work on Lutati her instincts would override any sense of schedule they tried to instill. 

On Sagga, sleep came in two shifts. Two bursts of a few hours when both Ava and Mira took their leave and allowed darkness to envelop one side of the planet. The in-between period when the light was soft and the world was dozy was Crea's favourite time to get things done. There was something about Mira's light, more distant and cooler, which helped Crea to think. 

Mira setting did not stop her from thinking however. She could be productive just as well in darkness. Ava rising was always a surprise, and a reminder to her body and mind to collapse. To hide away and squeeze in some rest before the rest of the world realised she was missing.

Lutati was eternally bathed in half light from both stars, but the eyemask they had given her to help her sleep lay untouched in a desk drawer. The first while here alone, Crea's hammock was installed in the deeper cave, too. She moved it forward herself, closer to the light, but also closer to her work, closer to the library.

Crea's eyes snapped open. Air filled her lungs and she swung her legs over the side of the hammock before her brain had fully kicked in. From the chest by the cave entrance she took a different bean. This did not spawn more of its own when heated, but to her mind was far more valuable. The one crop from Earth which had survived on Sagga, though her biologist friend had once told her it took a whole handful of beans to make a pot of coffee on Earth, and you had to grind them first. Eearth people had all kinds of intricate rituals around preparing it, but on Sagga, by Crea's generation  at least, they only had one way. On Sagga, however, water was not in short supply. Crea's coffee beans were modified, not only to generate their own liquid, but also to stand in as a replacement for a full meal. 

She moved to drop the bean in the pot, but it was still encrusted with brown goop from her previous meal. She pocketed the bean instead and scoured the pot with her sonic emitter. 

A memory stirred, of a new discover. Not a real memory, one of a dream. Still scrubbing the pot, Crea wandered to her desk. She stopped short; there were marks in the ground beneath her chair. It was a symbol from one of the books, sketched into the sand. Parallel lines, forming circles and a sweeping arc, in duplicate, mirroring each other.

Her mother's house, her mother's kitchen. No matter how long Crea had been away in the city, she was always welcome there. The fragrance of her mother's specially blended herbal tea, a unique combination of Saggan plants, filled her nostrils, and the back of her throat.

Crea placed her fingertips in the grooves in the sand, and they fit perfectly. Four lines, four fingers. In between the mirrored symbols were thinner incoherent lines, where her hair had dusted the ground as she hung upside down yesterday. She dropped the pot and hopped into the seat, leaning backwards once more. Her hands rested one each on the markings, and the arcs ended at her arms' maximum reach.

She sat upright, yearning for her mother's tea, and vaguely astonished that she had been studying the volumes so hard that symbols had impressed themsevles on her subconscious to such an extent that she was drawing them in the sand without realising.

Her stomach growled, and she obeyed its call.

Coffee was best enjoyed in direct sunlight; she took the steaming bowl to the roof of the cave and watched Lutati as she sipped. Nothing moved. Not a spiral of dust, not a breeze across the plains.

Did the crevasses lead all the way through, to the other side of the moon? What would falling through be like? She had never had the opportunity to peer down; did the light reach all the way? Who had lived here, once upon a time? Maybe the crevasses had been rivers. The coffee went from bitter to floral on her tongue and she almost spat it out. As she swallowed, the taste returned to normal. 

When she was a child, Crea drove her mother crazy by sitting on the kitchen worktop, willing the water to boil. Her mother would lift her down, *always in the way*, and Crea would scramble right back up as soon as her back was turned, pulling out a drawer to use for a leg up. As an adult, she would sit there too, challenging her mother to lift her down *now*.

Crea approached her desk but hesitated a moment before she sat down. She turned back and went to change her shirt, from one reddish brown sleeveless top to a green one. She added the former to a small pile by the hammock. She could take care of laundry later. 

She woke up her computer with a tap on the screen. First, she closed the transmission software, which was blinking a frantic *no connection* message. Behind that, her most recent book analysis waited. It was done, but she rotated the image on the screen anyway, surveying it one last time before moving on to the next one. The 3D model was not a photographic replica, but was overlaid with a dark brown texture to give it the feel of the real thing. The patterns on the cover, embossed as they were, had been easily picked up by Crea's software and glowed with coloured highlights. Green ones had been positively matched to icons already in the database, and blue needed manual confirmation. That was just on the surface though. In the background, the system was processing and computing every combination of lines, both within individual symbols and between them. From the patterns the software had found so far, Crea had been able to determine with reasonably certainty that the characters on the book covers constituted a spiral, to be read from the center outwards. Or the outer tip inwards. *What* they read, on the other hand, was still to be discovered. As crea had progressed deeper into the archives, the symbols had become more elaborate, or perhaps less controlled, more chaotic. Deeper in meant further back, away from the door, towards the far wall. Literally deeper in terms of the stacks of books. She was about half way through the first room. The software had lost track for a while, but it was a straightforward matter for her to recalibrate it once she had caught on.

One hundred and eighty degrees around, a flash of red suddenly dominated. In the bottom corner of the back - what she supposed was the back - the software had highlighted an unfamiliar symbol. Crea zoomed in, digitally and physically. It was at the tip of the spiral, and the icon itself was spiral in nature. Crea curled her hand into a fist, and held it up to the screen. With her other hand, she reoriented and increased the size of the icon until the pattern matched the spiral formed by her first finger and thumb. Even the ridges of her knuckles matched the shape on the screen. Crea turned her fist a little, and knocked lightly on the screen. She let go of the breath she didn't realise she had been holding.

Her computer chirruped, nudged by her contact with it, prompting for acknowledgement of a brand new combination of lines. She stepped back, then reached forward and tapped the confirmation. The symbol turned green.

Crea zoomed all the way out. She rotated the model three hundred and sixty degrees once more to be on the safe side. Using her whole hand, she swept the image away, and the next appeared. The symbols lit up, one by one, in blue or green. She attended to the blue ones - confirming whether or not she had seen them before. In all cases she had, two on the front and two on the back (probably the back). She matched each with similar ones the software suggested. None of the volumes she had analysed so far had any symbols on their spine. Each was adorned with a single wavy line, all alike.

Her game plan was process all of the covers, using the database and the software's pattern matching as an extension of her own senses, and hope that what emerged would eventually fall into place and exude some kind of meaning. Her system also contained a database of every known alphabet from Earth, ancient and not so ancient. A few parallells had emerged so far, but Crea had dismissed them as coincidental. The odds of a written language, even the essence of one, travelling millions of lightyears in either direction seemed pretty remote to her. As for her own arsenal, Crea's mother had taught her an ancestral language, passed down through generations, little changed - for hundreds of years at least - although little spoken as well. Her ancestors, an ancient culture on Earth, had been colonised a very long time ago, and a majority of their traditions were lost. Many of the original settlers of Sagga had the same heritage as Crea's mother, a displaced people looking for a new home, though few spoke the languages from their past.

Crea proceeded to categorise seven or eight more volumes in the same way. She was not a language expert, and relied heavily on the software. When she wasn't working on the discovery directly though she was perusing the archives, trying to consume all she could. Before her long term station on Lutati, she had studied all she could on sagga too, in preparation. She had visited all twenty one universities to speak to professors and researchers with areas of expertise she lacked. She dropped in on classes, hassled students, and tailgated into specialist libraries. The room she stayed in in the city was yet filled with overdue or unofficially borrowed books.

A year and a half ago she had been planning a new museum exhibit, and simultaneously writing a proposal to petition a museum or department somewhere (anywhere) to take her on to develop exhibition software. She had been reading about the Lutati discovery in the news just like everybody else. She didn't know her own advisor from her graduate thesis had been involved; all the glory and exposure was being given to the the astronauts who had been charting Lutati's terrain and found the cave in the first place. The minutae of the subsequent excavation was little covered.

Professor Hirana Matui had messaged Crea directly with these minutae, and invited her for a chat about the discovery's historical significance. The message had remained buried for two days before Crea noticed it. She dropped everything to head to Hirana's office.

The implications that the discovery had for understanding anything at all about life on Sagga before humans arrived were profound.  It was the first sign they had ever found of civilisation. Hirana had talked to several potential candidates for excavating the full extent of the finding; experts who were fascinated with the materials, the language, the process for getting books onto a moon. They started putting together a team, and Crea was the missing piece. Someone to process the content of the books, to make sense of the revelations within. To assemble and, most importantly, to communicate the stories of the Saggans who came before. Crea had dropped everything. They pulled together funding, and began training within weeks.

A month in, the linguist was called away to a more pressing government project. The materials scientist was next; he had a family emergency. The archaeologist was deterred by the training process itself, and agreed to participate under the condition that he could remain on Sagga and work with rock samples and digital images. 

Crea persisted, waiting for Hirana to enroll the next best experts into training. There were a few on the cards, but somehow they never came.

One dreary afternoon, Crea had taken her leave of the training encampment through a hole in the fence out of sign of the front gate. It had taken her three hours to walk to the city; arriving so soon felt like a pleasant break after she had been walking the circumference of Lutati every few days recently. She trod the familiar hallways to Hirana's campus office and let herself in without knocking. Hirana swiveled their chair and surveyed their bedraggled former student with their head cocked to one side and a look of wry amusement. Crea sat without being invited, shunting papers aside on the barely visible couch. The launch date was drawing near and Crea had no idea about how she was expected to do this alone. She had read and re-read the deliverables of the project, and was most conspicuously unqualified for the tasks ahead. She was concerned that there was not really enough time left to sufficiently train new team members for life on a moon, unless they already happened to be astronauts.

Hirana reassured Crea that she didn't need to know everything, and didn't need to meet all of their goals alone. They demonstrated the software that was almost ready for analysing the 3D scans, and produced photos of the environment on Lutati that was already being set up for Crea's occupation.

*Just me?*

Hirana had shrugged. They would be the first one by her side, had they not a family to supervise. Not to mention three fresh graduate students.

Hirana plied the weary Crea with coffee, then accompanied her on the tramline to the outer reach of Sagga City. Crea held Hirana for just a moment longer than usual as they hugged farewell.

Crea's confinement and astro training had concluded not so long afterwards. Back in the city, Crea set about honing skills and searching out information she never knew she would need.

After a while, Crea's head began to swim. She had lost count of the covers she had looked at so far, and coudn't shake the feeling that she was missing something today. She walked to the back of the cave, around a corner to the right, and surveyed the door. The Door.  The door that had started it all. Against the rules, she ran her hands lightly over its surface. The engravings were barely visible, a whisper on the surface of well-worn rock. To the casual observer, it might just be a particularly gnarled section of the wall. A digital scan had revealed the markings at once, but nothing compared to physical contact. Under her fingertips, the message was clear. 

The first time she came here, a technician told her that behind this wall was a vast cavern, and that the cavern contained something - or many things - that weren't rock. They just needed to find a way in to find out what. The technician's name began with B, and he was young. He wasn't still, even for a minute, as Crea watched him setting up and tweaking the devices which could see through rock. He showed Crea the door on his handheld screen. They didn't know it was a door yet, just a distinctly marked section of the wall. The markings were from floor to ceiling, and when Crea stood with her arms outstretched they reached from the fingertips of her left hand to the fingertips of her right. She stood like this on many occasions over the following weeks, sometimes with her eyes closed and her face so close to the wall she was breathing its dust. B buzzed around, adjusting things. Crea ignored him.

The deep orange light from outside made it through to this part of the cave at all hours, but Crea's favourite time to sit in the corridor was when Ava was just disappearing out of view from the front of the cave, and the shadows cast highlighted the edges of the engravings. The angle was right for mere moments, but it wasn't long before Crea made a habit of catching it when the time came every few days.

Once, B had been explaining some modifications he had made to the sensors when Ava caught Crea's attention and she excused herself. B followed her to the corridor, still talking, but he stopped when she sat cross-legged on the floor opposite the door, leaned forward with her elbows on the floor and placed her head in her hands. He was blocking the light, and obeyed at once when she waved at him to move.

From her position looking up at the wall, the shadows cast by the carvings formed lines which spidered and crisscrossed towards the ceiling. For a few seconds they were sharp, and as Ava shifted further out of sight they began to blur and stretch. All but one. By the floor was a shadow which did not interact with Ava's light in the same way, didn't follow the same patterns as its fellows. The carving which cast it was deeper than the rest. When B took a bathroom break from following her around, Crea carefully dug the dust out, then waited for the next opportunity for Ava to light up the wall.

The next time, the carving cast a half moon. The minute of Ava's passage was eternal; Crea watched the slow motion journey of the crescent as it rolled across the floor and then a little up. All of a sudden it grew, filled itself, faded and was gone, merging into the pale light that was a result of what remained of Ava and Mira's combined illumination in the corridor.

By the time Crea had understood the door's message, the excavation staff had rotated thrice. With each departure, she had the opportunity to take a break on Sagga, but something kept her in the cave. 

In the center of the crescent shadow was a tiny nick. It hadn't registered on any of the scans as a deliberate mark, and it had taken Crea weeks to discover that it was the start of a trail. The trail was a smattering of similar nicks, winding their way across the wall. There was little to distinguish them from random decay. They lead up and around, winding like a river across the landscape of the cave tunnel. She followed the trail, marking its course on paper. Sometimes the trail forked or ran back over itself. Sometimes she got lost and had to search for the next clue. Crea drew a map, and noted other natural fissures, dips and elevations. 

One day she had been musing over the map in the entrance to the cave when a technician stopped by to offer her some tea. She took the cup absently, and the guy remained, looking over her shoulder at the map. He asked her why she was studying the Zhira region of Sagga.

Crea had blinked, and suddenly it became clear. Transparent. She was a fool for not seeing it sooner. Well, perhaps not a fool. It had been many years since her marine geography classes. But it came flooding back at once. (Pun intended.) Most of Sagga was deep under water, but the shallowest region was a short boat ride from the mainland. The sheets of paper spread before her displayed an almost perfect sketch of that area. The river she had drawn was a well-known current trail. Sailors used it actively to navigate the region quickly. If you let the current carry you freely, it whirled you out to a submerged volcano. The water was so clear that people would head out and spend days surveying the lifeless depths. The sides of the volcano were stacked with crystals. The light from Ava and Mira refracted through them and the water, creating rainbow displays comparable to the Aurora Borealis told of in stories from Earth.

The volcano was in the center of Crea's map, formed by a circular pit in the wall with jutting edges. The river / current trail spiraled around it several times, and out in four directions from there. The volcano (which needs a name) was one of the better explored parts of subterranean Sagga. The crater in its peak provided the entrance to a network of tunnels which snaked their way through the landmass of the planet. Many of them emerged as hot springs across the mainland.

Crea ran to the wall in the cave and examined the miniature volcano. She stuck her fingers in the hole, and dust and dirt gave way under pressure. She knocked on the wall in different places, and was rewarded with different vibrations. The technicians had scanned the wall on her request, and sure enough, a micro version of the underwater tunnel network wormed its way throughout the wall. Indeed, there were many tunnels in the wall that none of them had seen on any full-size surveys of the volcanic area.

The natural reaction to a small round hole is to want to pop things in it, isn't it?

Since that day, Crea had kept safe the pebble she had picked up from the cave entrance and polished into a perfect sphere. It fit into the hole, and rattled pleasantly as it rolled through the tunnels. She waited patiently for the clunk of an obstruction, and took the tiny metal rod one of the technicians had furnished her with the first fateful time she had put the ball in the hole, and poked it into a tiny pinprick of a hole in the wall which in real life corresponded to a popular hot spring not far from Sagga City. She angled the rod just right (this had taken a while to crack) and something inside the wall shifted, allowing the ball to proceed. Three more carefully implemented interventions from Crea and the metal rod, and the ball reached the critical part of its path. With a groan, the carved area of the wall suddenly separated. Seams appeared where there were none before. Now the door could be pushed gently, and spun on a central hinge. Crea stepped inside the room, and retrieved the ball from the small groove which caught it at knee height beside the door.

------------------
------------------

(get out of my head)

Crea was freezing. She pressed her eyes closed and tried to go back to sleep. She tried to tug her blanket tighter but it wasn't there. But she was wrapped tightly in something. Something padded. A coat. Where had this come from? The hammock was no longer swaying.. No longer there either. Cold hard concrete pressed at her through the meager padding of the coat. She pushed her body against the only thing that seemed still to be comfortable, and that thing moved and grunted. Hyyon, her love, was soft and padded but freezing just the same. His beard and eyebrows and fringes of his fur hood were crusted in ice.

She reached up a trembling hand to caress his pale cheek, but felt nothing. Not even the pressure from the inside of her glove. His lips were blue. She supposed hers were as well. She licked them and found nothing. 

---------------------------
---------------------------

Slow it down, these reactions don't have to happen all at once. You're angry now, but later you might just love. (Do you love?) You don't have to swallow the anger, don't repress it. But you don't need to express it either. Do you want to hurt everyone around you? Feel the blood pound in your chest. Feel your fingernails cut grooves into your palms. Feel the scream catch in your throat and the fire burning behind your eyes. Feel these things and feel them some more. Let the scream tighten and ball up. Fill your airway, halt your breath. But don't let it go. The ringing in your ears turns to burning and joins forces with the rest of the fire in your face, filling your head with static. Formless and overwhelming. Let tears leak from the corners of your eyes. Feel them glide down your cheeks. One tiny ball of salty liquid slips into the corner of your mouth and it tastes like rage.

Do not say what you are thinking.

This moment, like every moment, will pass. Right now, you cannot speak, only spit. Every word is a weapon, every sentence an offensive. Do not say anything. Even if you try to be level it will come out twisted. The nicest remark has a brutal edge. Do not cut your friends just because of the pain in your own chest. They feel their own pain.

Do you feel it? The prickling sensation thorughout your body? Every hair standing on end? You are surrounded by crackling electricity. You are ready to *explode*. You cannot keep this pain inside you, it permeates the air.

It will pass.

Close your eyes and bathe in the pain. If the tears come, let them come. Feel them, take them. Don't wipe them away. Lie still and feel your blood coursing through your veins. Feel every millimeter of your circulatory system. Choose a blood vessel and travel with it, from your heart, through your limbs, around your organs, and back to your heart. Track one which travels up, through your brain. Sit aboard the tour bus, witness the fireworks of neurons firing. The road is being built, even as you travel it.

When you re-emerge, the world has changed. The things you wanted to scream are forgotten. The messages you typed and never sent, no longer make sense. Towards your tormentor, you feel only love. They were never your tormentor; just another person in pain.
