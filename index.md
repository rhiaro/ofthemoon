# Of the moon

The transmission window would open in a few hours, but Crea had more to add to the messages she would send out. She had finished updating her formal notes. Now she was excited to recount recent developments for her mother. She had prepared a video message weeks ago, and she was approaching the maximum amount of data she could send before the window closed, so she contented herself with attaching an audio recording. She had to remember to leave space for a hasty response to whatever her mother would say to her, too, when the message came through. But it would be tough! There was so much to tell.

It had really all come out of nowhere in the past few days. First, she had discovered a new door! Cunningly disguised as yet more rock, what tipped her off were the engravings she was just beginning to learn to interpret. She noticed patterns that matched the first door they had found. Her scanner hadn't picked them up because they weren't duplicates, but a second half. A continuation of each symbol, that aligned perfectly. She needed to recalibrate her equipment to look for more of that. She had a feeling the patterns weren't complete yet. That is... she had a feeling there were more doors.

It had only taken her three days (by the Earth's rotation) to open this one. She was finally beginning to understand this place. Understand wasn't the right word though. It wasn't very scientific, but she was beginning to *intuit* this place. The first one had taken three and a half months, and she had achieved that after others had been working on it for... Well, she didn't know. Nobody had mentioned. But she had the impression it had been a very long time. She had been hailed as a genius when she succeeded. She had almost given up, convinced after one hundred days that she was getting nowhere. Confused as to why her funding hadn't been pulled after so much time with no results. But she did it, and now she was running the place. It was all hers.

Crea had a whole moon to herself.

And what a moon! Behind the new door, was a new room. That was even more exciting than the door. It contained tomes. Giant manuscripts, stacks upon stacks. They were made of the same kind of thick, leaf textured papyrus as the ones in the first chamber, but subtly heavier, and more yellowed in tone. The inscriptions were smaller, too. Crea hadn't figured out what the ink was made from yet, but she suspected that the greater concentration of the writing contributed towards the weight.

This was not the most incredible thing however. The most incredible thing was behind the tomes. A three dimensional scan of the space had revealed it at once. Behind rows of towers of books, were tablets. *Engraved* tablets. The scan was high quality; Crea didn't need to access them to visualise their surface. Slabs of rock - not the same rock that the cave walls were made from - it was utterly unfamiliar in makeup. But the materials in this place were a secondary priority, anyway. The pieces were slotted into the wall itself, held in individually carved spaces. And the wall was *full*. Some of the pieces were stacked against the side, like headstones in an overcrowded graveyard, and later (she assumed) covered with the books.

There was so much here. Twice as much as they suspected, at least. She barely knew where to start. Except... and breathe... She did know where to start. At the entrance. She should not get carried away with the second chamber. And she had all the time she needed. She would study all of it, she felt sure.

After this afternoon's transmission, nobody would disturb her again for another six months. Crea checked her timer, checked her remaining disc space, and saved the recording. Her mother was the only person who enjoyed listening to her ramble on about her work, or at least who could do a good impression of doing so. She attached the audio to the package of data poised to be transmitted out when the airwaves were clear, and started randomly browsing her notes in case she'd missed something critical the scientists on the planet's surface would need to see. She had a lot of notes.

Crea checked her timer again. Ten Earth minutes had passed. Four Sagga minutes. Lutati didn't have minutes. Nothing changed enough on the moon to make it worth measuring. The transmission window was to open on Earth's schedule, even though no-one from Earth would be sending or receiving anything. Most official things still ran on Earth's schedule, in fact. When Crea was a student, she had taken part in a  campaign for the university to use Sagga's timing primarily. Once, she and her friends had broken into a laboratory and re-calibrated all of the equipment. They didn't know what the equipment was used for, or even what went on in that laboratory. Alarms had sounded, and the campus had been shut down for almost a week. The five of them had escaped through a window, broken into a nearby dormitory, and laid low in the closet of a sympathetic first year for two days. The kid was terrified of getting caught, and went out to buy them food rather than let them order pizza for delivery. He switched dorms a week later.

The university never did adjust its timekeeping, maintaining good relations with collaborators on Earth was too important. They had plenty to say a year later when Earth's Council for Extraterrestrial Affairs excluded academics from Sagga from applying for joint grant funding with Earth-based institutions however. Sagga needed to strike out on its own, the Council said, assert itself as an independent nation. Besides, collaboration through the wormhole was time-consuming and resource-intensive. Crea and most of her friends at the time agreed with the university's new position that Earth was abandoning them, and they were better off without. Earth took too much, and gave too little in return.

Crea had been at a protest, too, a year after *that*, when a delegation from Sagga had gone to Earth to negotiate complete devolution of power to the Board of Overseers. Devolution was not enough; they wanted independence. They didn't know it at the time, but that was to be the last ever use of the Lunar Passageway. It took a while for people to realise that the delegation was not coming back. The last message from Earth - that operation of the Lunar Passageway was ceasing until further notice - shook the small nation into action. After barely a year of floundering, the new Government of Sagga was pouring everything it had into scientific research and technological development. Everyone had a job to do. Those who lacked expertise were trained. Sagga's environment was coaxed into flourishing despite the altitude of the land, and its sole city began to expand into a state. 

In between mandatory tech placements, Crea studied her heritage. The second generation of native Saggans was being born, and they might never know of Earth. She grilled her mother for everything she knew of the blue planet, even though she had been young when she arrived on Sagga. She pursued her mother's friends, their parents if they were still around, then chased the gradually settling refugees; those who had been visiting Sagga when the wormhole was closed, who had been left stranded. Crea's thesis was a vast compendium of interviews; an interactive archive of experiences of the early settlers and their descendants. One could view it, and even add to it, at the Sagga Museum, alongside Earthly artifacts like tree branches and shells.

Science and industry continued to use time keeping instruments based on the rotations of a planet in another galaxy; of a star half way across the universe.

No matter how you measured it, time was standing still for Crea. Still one hour to go before she could transmit. Crea stepped away from her console and walked around the corner, to the entrance of her cave. On her way out, she shed her loose jacket, depositing it in a heap on the floor. She curled her toes over the edge of the rock that formed her entry way, and let the vertigo seize her for a moment. The cave was in the side of a sheer cliff and the entry way jutted out over an impossible drop. There were steps beside the entrance, leading up and over. They were mostly a natural formation, but Crea had helped them take shape a little by grinding away sharp edges. She took them delicately, on tiptoes, her arms spread wide for balance. Her heart was racing by the end of the steep ten minute climb to the very peak of the cliff, and her feet were covered in the soft orange pink dust that coated this moon.

At the top, she sat cross-legged. The sun of the perpetual dusk warmed her bare arms. The larger star, Ava, dipped below the horizon directly ahead, and Crea could feel the warmth from its sibling Mira on the back of her head. The sky was shot with oranges, pinks and reds. The planet Sagga was a white smudge. Her mother would be  preparing a meal usually at this time, but today she would instead be fussing around unfamiliar technology, afraid to miss the call from her daughter, and excited to transmit her own message. The house would be uncomfortably full of scientists and beeping devices, and probably one or two people from the authorities. There would be black, serious looking vehicles outside, and equally serious looking guards to protect the beeping devices. Her mother, amidst the flurry, would be somehow keeping them all liberally supplied with tea.

Crea spent a moment more looking across the landscape. Her moon, Lutati, was broken and uneven. More a cluster of rocks held together by the miracle of gravity than a complete entity. She could walk its perimeter, and arrive back where she started, in a few days if it was flat. When she trained for this assignment, she had been made to walk enormous distances on Sagga. It was for naught, as the moon was torn to pieces; there was no route she could take that wasn't split by an impassable crevasse.

Crea closed her eyes. Nothing moved but the tiny hairs above her lip as her breath floated by. Her breath was a gentle hum; almost silent, but the only sound in the world. Her ankle buzzed, disgruntled at the pressure she was putting on it. The backs of her hands tingled at their contact with the linen of her trousers, and the tops of her knees were warmed by the backs of her hands. Her buttocks communed with every grain of dust beneath her. Her lower back was heating up, and discomfort seeped around her kidneys. Crea straightened her spine. The movement caused tips of her hair to tickle the back of her neck. The ground beneath her passed on messages from the cave below; the hum of her equipment, coupled with vibrations of the secrets held within. The top of her head was cool, out of direct line of either Ava or Mira. The moon's gravity pulled gently at the hundreds of hairs protruding from her scalp. An itch arose on her left forearm. The sensation teased her for a moment, and then was gone.

On Sagga there was always wind. It tousled her hair, lifted it and threw around, and the lower gravity meant Crea always looked wild. Most people covered their heads, to go outside if not all the time, but Crea imagined she was being tugged into space. Great hands reached for her from above, and they needed something to latch on to. Now she was here, nothing was tugging her back to Sagga. The moon had her, and she had the moon. Nothing tousled her here; all was still, all was stable.

The air was warm when it entered her lungs, but warmer when it left. The insides of her nostrils affirmed it. Crea was sharing energy with the moon, a fair exchange. The atmosphere seeped into every pore of her skin. It took longer to get to her legs, back and chest, first having to pass through her clothes. It made it though, and caressed every part of her body. The moon embraced Crea, and her heart opened wider in return.

Crea softly opened her eyes. She blinked Lutati's landscape back into focus. Sagga's primary moon, Bella, and the Lunar Passageway station itself had made an appearance on the horizon, so it would soon be time. Crea had been to Bella twice, but stepped foot on its surface only once. It didn't really count though, because she hadn't breathed its air, touched its atmosphere. Bella didn't have an atmosphere to speak of. Crea had spent the entire journey from Sagga to Bella begging, sweet talking, and otherwise cajoling the shuttle captain to let her try on a space suit and step outside. She had the training to do so, after all. After much reluctance and much breaching of protocol, and under very close supervision, and only for one minute mind you, the captain conceded. Bella was grey, like Earth's moon. It's surface was gritty and crumbly where Lutati was soft and powdered.

Crea rose slowly, and took the steps down to the cave entrance one by one. On the way back in she retrieved her jacked and slipped her feet into loose sackcloth shoes, and padded back to her workstation. Her seat was suspended from the roof of the cave - an anti-sand measure which didn't work because she immediately tucker her feet underneath herself without dusting them off. It squeaked as she reached for her screen. With a few taps and swipes she lined the files up for transmission. Her message to her mother first, and then the data she had collected and the analysis she'd done so far. Whilst they were sending, she could download incoming transmissions. She would have time to watch or listen to a message from her mother and to record a response to add to the end of the queue. It would finish sending just before the window closed. 

The visitors to her mother's house would be doing the same thing on their end. If they were all lucky, an additional message from her mother might squeeze through in the last moments, too.

Crea was poised.

*boop*

The transmitter kicked into life. Each message was broken into chunks by her software (it was hers, at least, she helped write it), packaged and repackaged until it could be propelled through space. With each chunk sent, a square on the screen filled with colour. The display was split, to show progress on their end as well as hers. When each bundle of data reached its destination, a square was filled in on their side too. Sometimes one didn't make it intact, and Crea had to nudge it to send again. The chunks might arrive out of order, but they would put it all back together.

Nothing had arrived yet. Crea's transmitter was sending, but the data had a long way to go. The waves of energy squeezed out of Lutati's thick atmosphere, propelling a path between particles. Then they would hit the vacuum of space and surge forward. In the wrong direction. The station built around the Lunar Passageway provided an ad hoc deflector to redirect them. They bounced once, into Bella. This slowed their particles down considerably, and changed their direction once more. The next time they entered the vacuum, they were bound for Sagga. The antenna installed in the field behind Crea's mother's house waited patiently as the data fought its final battle against the planet's atmosphere. Eventually the first packet would make it, the dish would send an acknowledging ping on a different frequency, and one of the 'received' squares would finally light up.

Crea waited.

She kicked her legs out from under her, scattering sand across the desk. She dropped to the ground and turned her swing seat inside out, shaking the rest of the dust to the floor. She brushed off her desk. One more packet sent, still none received. On either end. Lutati's atmosphere must be extra thick today.

Crea rolled her jacket sleeves down to her wrists, bouncing on the balls of her feet. She rolled them back up again. She twisted her black hair into a bun on the top of her head, dragging it round and round until it was so tight it hurt. She let go and it tumbled back down to her shoulders. She placed her palms on the desk and leaned forward until her nose was almost touching the screen. The static made her skin bristle, and from here she could hear its hum. Crea stepped back, hands on her hips, a frown furrowing her brow. She perched back into her chair, but not all the way, so her feet still brushed the ground. With a big toe, she drew shapes in the sand.

*Ugh.*

An exasperated sigh. She dropped to the ground again and peer around the back of her desk. The screen was plugged into the power source and the transmitter. The transmitter was plugged into the power source too, and its light was blinking rapidly. As it should be. She followed the cable from its third outlet down to the ground and up a narrow shoot in the rock behind her desk. She stretched as high as she could with her arm through the chute, fingering the cable as far as she could reach. She leaned back around to look at her screen, and sighed again.

Her sleeves were unrolled once more, and she chewed on a corner of the fabric. Briskly she re-rolled them, and jogged to the cave entrance. She turned right and scrambled up and over some rocks, no steps on the other side. Where the chute from inside the cave emerged, there was a small dish. She needlessly brushed sand from it as she crouched down, checking the cable here too. The dish was warm to touch, but not hot; a combination of the suns' heat and its electrical activity. Crea looked to the sky. The Lunar Passageway station was in alignment, outlined by the colossal grey Bella. Had Bella's orbit changed? Had they calculated something wrong? What if someone tampered with the deflector on the station? What if the Passageway itself had been reactivated? The particles it emitted would certainly interfere with her signal.

She chewed her lip, and looked further to Sagga, willing her messages home.

The only time Crea had been on the Lunar Passageway station was to protest. It was a unique occasion, with a special transport for protesters organised by the Sagga Association for Greater Autonomy (SA-GA). The flight from Sagga took two days, and in this instance around two hundred students were crammed into a commercial cargo transport shuttle. Crea had spent most of the journey pressed into a hard metal corner, carefully rationing the protein bars her backpack was bursting with, and catching up on reading for her latest technology development assignment. Others busted around, playing games, singing songs, making ever more elaborate signboards, and practicing their protest chants. Her two closest companions spent half of the journey trying to get onto the flight deck to question the crew about space aviation. Crea had declined to accompany them; they returned periodically with stories of their various failures, and eventually gave up, took sedatives, and went to sleep.

She had never taken an ordinary passenger shuttle off Sagga until her first trip to Lutati. Having a reclining seat, access to a food dispenser, and a much smaller person-to-bathroom ratio made for a much more enjoyable voage, despite Lutati's greater distance.

It was on board the transport to the Lunar Passageway station when Crea's interest in long distance communications had been piqued. An aside in one of the academic articles she had skimmed noted the difficulty of reliably transporting bulk loads of data from Earth to the machine-controlled base station on Mars, and back. The intricacies of this problem nestled in the back of her mind, and resurfaced again several months later when she was placed on a team tasked with building transmission software capable of reaching the outer edges of Sagga's solar system.

The vessel carrying the protesters docked at a transfer point on the surface of Bella, and they were hustled in small groups into pods, essentially elevators, to whoosh up to the Lunar Passageway station itself. Crea was lucky to make the cut. At some point, authorities cited capacity problems, and blocked about one third of the protesters from reaching the station. The recreational facilities at Bella were lacklustre at best, and dozens of impatient students were left to antagonise the security forces for several hours.

The Lunar Passageway station was shiny. It was in much better repair than the aging transfer station on the moon's surface. As her group was guided to an area set aside for demonstrators, Crea dawdled to absorb a history in pictures along its corridor walls. The images were three dimensional holograms, and the captions were engraved directly into the glimmering metal. They depicted the construction of the station following the discovery of Bella. The discovery of the Passageway itself by researchers on Earth's Moon had several meters dedicated to it. The international conflict about access to the Passageway, and the sudden availability of support for Moon infrastructure by nations previously not interested in funding space exploration was merely a footnote. The timeline skipped the years after construction of the transit stations on the moons at both ends, during which political division had prevented any real progress from being made. There was no mention of the private companies which had sprung up without government support. Credit for the discovery and subsequent occupation of Sagga was given to a cohort of international Earth organisations, containing governments, academic institutions, and enthusiastic citizen scientists.

From this history, the settlement of Sagga looked as peachy as Lutati's sands. A triumph for all nations on Earth, and a step towards the future.

On multiple occasions while she was compiling her thesis, Crea tried to arrange a return trip to the Lunar Passageway station to document this display first hand. With the Passageway closed by Earth, none of the shuttle lines had thought to operate transit for station tourism, and there was nothing for people to visit on Bella. Later, the only people who could access the station were diplomats, desperately trying to renegotiate access to Earth for those on Sagga.

Transmitting messages through the Lunar Passageway itself was a whole different ballgame. Much of the research for that, spanning the years since the Passageway's discovery, was closed. However, Crea had accessed what she could when she worked in a communications lab. The Passageway collapsed hundreds of lightyears of space into just a few kilometers distance. When the Passageway was open, one could see Earth's Moon from Bella, and vice versa. The respective stations at the ends of the Passageway were designed to permit that. The Lunar Window. 

The station above Bella hosted an enormous transparent panel to welcome new arrivals. Once inside the station proper, only space was visible through this window; it was angled to benefit those transiting through the Passageway.

From were Crea stood on the station during the protest, she had been able to see the Passageway open up as the shuttle housing the representatives from Sagga entered. Black, empty space shimmered. The void became a pool, quivering due to the proximity of matter. Then the Moon appeared, at first like a reflection in a lake, until it trembled into solidity. The Moon's transit station was a shining spec in orbit. The shuttle jetted off in its direction, and the whole apparition phased back out of existence.

*Did you see Earth?* Crea had heard someone nearby whisper excitedly. *That wasn't Earth. We can't see Earth from here. But we'll get there one day.*

Some of the protesters, perhaps, weren't here to impress upon the delegates the importance of Sagga's self-governance, but to try to glimpse the greener grass of the blue planet they had never seen.

Most of the data segments were sent, and it wouldn't be long until the transmission window closed altogether. Crea leaned forward on the desk, her elbows boring dents into the clear polycarbonate. She massaged her temples, pulled on her cheeks and earlobes, pressed her palms into her eyes.

*boop.*

The final package was sent. Her face an inch from the screen, Crea tapped the controls to re-send the first blob again. She ran her hands through her hair, bundling and unbundling it on the top of her head. It sent. Still nothing on the receiving end. Nothing from her mother. No acknowledgements.

Maybe it was just her end that was broken. Maybe everything had been sent fine and her equipment just wasn't receiving. There were probably ten people pushing buttons and swiping dials in her mother's kitchen right now, and nobody would be telling her mother what was going on. In fact, her mother would be blissfully unaware that anything was wrong at all, in another room, hand against her heart and tears in her eyes as she watched her daughter's video for the fifth time over.

*boop.*

Lutati, Bella and Sagga would be in alignment again in around another six months.

Crea dropped back into her swing seat, leaning all the way back. Her hair claimed particles of dust from the ground and her fingertips left trails in the sand. She breathed out, long and slow. She hung there until the blood rushing in her ears became too loud to bear. She hauled herself back upright then, and waited for the dizziness to pass. 

A glance at her screen; a gnaw of concern in the pit of her stomach. Crea wandered to the back of the part of the cave in which she lived. She placed her hands against the stone and closed her eyes. Behind this wall was *everything*. She could see every inch of every surface in the room. Her mind wandered across dusty volumes, traced the intricate patterns on their covers. Stories of a civilisation, waiting to be told.

She sighed and tramped deeper into the cave. The corridor narrowed and got darker; the ground began to slope downwards. She relinquished her grip and let gravity glide her cloth-covered feet over fine loose stones for a few moments. The narrow passage continued, but Crea turned right and hoisted herself through a hole in the wall. Without a light, you'd only know it was there if you knew it was there. She emerged behind a rock in a wide but low-ceilinged cavern. With her chin to her chest she advanced until her foot kicked into a box on the ground. She bent to turn it over, and the cavern was illuminated momentarily by two green lights blinking.  She dusted them off and put the box back down; the tension of the cables protruding from both sides jerked it back into its lights-down position. One cluster of several thing cables disappeared into a hole in the ground a couple of meters away. They connected to a power relay under her desk, which in turn kept her screen on and her flashlight and stove charged. The other cable was as thick as her wrist, and made its way through another tunnel across the cavern. At some point it forked, and emerged at the two positions on Lutati's surface with the most intense and consistent sunlight from Ava and Mira. Sheets of silver paneling covered the ground, soaking up the energy.

If anything went wrong with these, there was not a lot Crea could do. She had no means to traverse Lutati's inconveniently jagged terrain to reach them. This equipment was old, well tested, and notoriously reliable though. Panels like these had kept Sagga powered for decades, in the early years. She had a backup supply of good old fashioned oil stashed away for emergencies in any case, which would last six months on a budget.

So, energy source was good. She had better go back and run diagnostics on all the rest of her equipment too. Not that she had much, but if she was going to need to panic at all she was better off finding out sooner rather than later.

Back in her cave, Crea collected all of her electrical equipment into a heap on the floor. She had a device that made light, one that made heat, and one that made high frequency vibrations. They could be purposed in all kinds of ways, in various combinations, but primarily they served Crea as a flashlight for the cave tunnels, a stove, and a showerhead. She picked them up and put them down again, one by one. Paused for a moment. Picked the heater back up, and took it to the cave entrance. She stood it upright, flicked a switch to open upward facing support arms, and balanced a bowl atop those. On her right, set a little back from the entrance, was an enormous chest. From within she produced a bean the size of a pebble, which she dropped into the pot with a light clatter. She turned up the heat, and sat down beside the stove. In the distance, Bella had drifted further overhead and Ava had sifted just a little across the horizon. Crea's attention jolted back to the pot as the bean puffed up, doubling in size. It burst, spitting brown globules against the sides of the bowl; the globules continued to expand and sizzle. Crea reached into the pot with a pair of tongs and retrieved from the bubbling liquied a bean which looked a lot like the one she had put in to begin with. She returned it to its place in the chest, and idly stirred her simmering stew.

When she was a student, one of Crea's dorm mates studied plant sciences. She had gone on to be a key figure in developing self-replicating foods on Sagga. In another lifetime, Crea would learn how this process worked.

Crea smelled the contents of the pot. It smelt... brown. As always, it would be rich and satisfying, and provide her with all the nutrients she needed. She lowered the heat, and returned to the chest. She surveyed her sack of flour and gallon of water, neither of which were self-replicating. Into another bowl she scooped flour, and drizzled water, stirring it together with her hand, just enough until a ball formed. Crea took once more a seat on the ground at the cave entrance, and gazed up at Bella as she massaged the dough between her palms.

-----

Crea tossed and turned, making her hammock sway. She was too hot with the cover, but too cold without it. She never normally had trouble sleeping. This was the first time in over six months of being in the cave. The fact made her anxious. Or was it something else making her anxious? Her eyes were still squeezed closed, but for a fleeting moment she felt like she was being watched. The feeling passed at once, and she carefully slowed her breath, and didn't open her eyes. She could get up and work but... she was exhausted. She pictured herself sitting up, swinging her legs over the side and dropping the couple of inches to the floor. She imagined padding across the mat that kept most of the sand and grit off her feet, towards her desk in the far corner. The corner near the door. She would hoist herself up into the swing seat, then lean forwards and tap her screen. The screen would blink to life, showing her the most recent document scan she'd been working on. Which one was it? She couldn't quite recall. She had left off half way through the last one. She could swipe her finger around the screen to rotate the scan, pinch to zoom. She was searching for new symbols, something she hadn't come across yet to add to her dictionary. Some dictionary. What kind of dictionary only had icons but no definitions? No translation? But she would get there. She had time. First she needed to gather data, then she could analyse it. In her mind's eye, Crea saw herself zooming in on a section of the scan which the computer had marked with a red outline. There was something there that it hadn't been able to extract and automatically classify. She tried to make it out, but it was blurry. Maybe she should get up for real and take a look after all. She didn't remember noticing this highlighted section on the last piece she worked on though. Maybe she hadn't rotate it all the way around yet. The section was in the bottom at the center.. no in the corner. It was just the cover of the book, she hadn't even gone inside yet. The inscriptions on the pages appeared to be a completely different alphabet, so she had decided to take just the covers first. She had time. What was in the highlighted section? She really should get up and find out. She thought she was sitting up for a moment, but perhaps she had drifted off and dreamt it. She tried again, but her body was a boulder. Crea rolled onto her side. Her eyes were still closed, and it seemed impossible to wrench them open. She felt the course fabric of the hammock under her cheek where the sheet had wrinkled away. Her face and the material were joined, inextricably linked, as one. She couldn't get up. She nuzzled the hammock and stretched her limbs. A small groan escaped her. She either needed to get up and do some work or go to sleep, really. She couldn't just stay here, neither being productive nor restoring her energy. Why did she feel so heavy? Finally she lurched upright and swung her legs over the edge. For real this time. She pulled the cover aside and felt the taught rim of the hammock in the backs of her knees. She allowed herself to lean forwards, unconsciously stretching her toes for the floor. Crea slipped off the edge, and the floor never came.

She jerked awake, heart in her mouth. Still in the hammock. Her eyes were open now but she could see nothing in the darkness. Her breathing slowed. She pulled the cover around her shoulders and stared at the ceiling. Resisting the urge to look over at her desk. She remembered she had finished the last cover she had been analysing after all. There had been only one new symbol, and a handful of new combinations. Nothing the computer couldn't read, that was for sure. She had begun to feel hopeful that perhaps she was starting to get a complete picture, of the covers at least. But something niggled. What if she had missed something? She had got through dozens of the books so far, and with the computer to help her she was normally confident of her progress. In any case, she could check in the morning. Just to be on the safe side. The sense of urgency was gone altogether now; her dream faded.

Crea rolled over again, this time onto her right side, facing away from the desk. Finally she was ready to sleep. Thoughts of enormous books, stone tablets, and mysterious carvings flitted through her mind, but dissipated as quickly as they came. She sank gently into oblivion.

On the other side of the cave, her screen flickered to life and the computer started to reanalyse the file that had been open last. This time, it found something different.
