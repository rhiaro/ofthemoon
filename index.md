# Of the moon

The transmission window would open in a few hours, but Crea had more to add to the messages she would send out. She had finished updating her formal notes. Now she was excited to recount recent developments for her mother. She had prepared a video message weeks ago, and she was approaching the maximum amount of data she could send before the window closed, so she contented herself with attaching an audio recording. She had to remember to leave space for a hasty response to whatever her mother would say to her, too, when the message came through. But it would be tough! There was so much to tell.

It had really all come out of nowhere in the past few days. First, she had discovered a new door! Cunningly disguised as yet more rock, what tipped her off were the engravings she was just beginning to learn to interpret. She noticed patterns that matched the first door they had found. Her scanner hadn't picked them up because they weren't duplicates, but a second half. A continuation of each symbol, that aligned perfectly. She needed to recalibrate her equipment to look for more of that. She had a feeling the patterns weren't complete yet. That is... she had a feeling there were more doors.

It had only taken her three days (by the Earth's rotation) to open this one. She was finally beginning to understand this place. Understand wasn't the right word though. It wasn't very scientific, but she was beginning to *intuit* this place. The first one had taken three and a half months, and she had achieved that after others had been working on it for... Well, she didn't know. Nobody had mentioned. But she had the impression it had been a very long time. She had been hailed as a genius when she succeeded. She had almost given up, convinced after one hundred days that she was getting nowhere. Confused as to why her funding hadn't been pulled after so much time with no results. But she did it, and now she was running the place. It was all hers.

Crea had a whole moon to herself.

And what a moon! Behind the new door, was a new room. That was even more exciting than the door. It contained tomes. Giant manuscripts, stacks upon stacks. They were made of the same kind of thick, leaf textured papyrus as the ones in the first chamber, but subtly heavier, and more yellowed in tone. The inscriptions were smaller, too. Crea hadn't figured out what the ink was made from yet, but she suspected that the greater concentration of the writing contributed towards the weight.

This was not the most incredible thing however. The most incredible thing was behind the tomes. A three dimensional scan of the space had revealed it at once. Behind rows of towers of books, were tablets. *Engraved* tablets. The scan was high quality; Crea didn't need to access them to visualise their surface. Slabs of rock - not the same rock that the cave walls were made from - it was utterly unfamiliar in makeup. But the materials in this place were a secondary priority, anyway. The pieces were slotted into the wall itself, held in individually carved spaces. And the wall was *full*. Some of the pieces were stacked against the side, like headstones in an overcrowded graveyard, and later (she assumed) covered with the books.

There was so much here. Twice as much as they suspected, at least. She barely knew where to start. Except... and breathe... She did know where to start. At the entrance. She should not get carried away with the second chamber. And she had all the time she needed. She would study all of it, she felt sure.

After this afternoon's transmission, nobody would disturb her again for another six months. Crea checked her timer, checked her remaining disc space, and saved the recording. Her mother was the only person who enjoyed listening to her ramble on about her work, or at least who could do a good impression of doing so. She attached the audio to the package of data poised to be transmitted out when the airwaves were clear, and started randomly browsing her notes in case she'd missed something critical the scientists on the planet's surface would need to see. She had a lot of notes.
